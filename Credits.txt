|==============|TOOLS USED|==============|
A list of all the tools I have used to make my own assets for this mod, and what I used them for.

Blender (https://www.blender.org/): Modelling, texturing, and animating the actual vehicles.
Sprite Batch Render Ex (https://github.com/nashmuhandes/SpriteBatchRender): Blender addon, used to render the vehicles into sprites with proper sprite names, I use the Blender3.2.1 branch.
Batch Image Manipulation Program (https://alessandrofrancesconi.it/projects/bimp/): Used to autocrop, convert to 8-Bit PNGs, and compress my sprites en mass. Here is a link to set of image manipulations I use(May be outdated): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yyq1X-TClofjVrcsoOsGxSPzehcS-Ads/view?usp=sharing
SLADE: Used to automatically offset the sprites, and then for me to also manually adjust the offsets to be more accurate.
DeflOpt, PNGCrush, PNGout: Plugged into SLADE, and used to even further compress sprites. Here is a guide on how to do that and where to find these programs: https://imgur.com/a/DJ4x4hS
