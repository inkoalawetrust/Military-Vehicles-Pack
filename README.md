# NOTE:
***It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you use this mod with my [Smart Marine](https://github.com/inkoalawetrust/Smart-Marines/) mod, if you don't, the MVP will fall back to spawning [the default crappy ZDoom marines](https://zdoom.org/wiki/Classes:ScriptedMarine) instead for vehicles that drop soldiers. I am not liable for any frustrating and moronic behavior they (ZDoom marines) exhibit, and DO NOT REPORT ANY BUGS UNLESS THE SMART MARINES ARE ALSO INCLUDED OR LOADED ALONGSIDE YOUR PROJECT !***

Any mention of marines from now on will be about my own marine NPCs.

# Military-Vehicles-Pack
A GZDoom mod that contains a pack of military vehicle NPCs and props, for use in mods and maps.

## What is this ?
Exactly what the description says, a GZDoom mod that contains a pack of military vehicles, that can be used as full fledged NPCs and/or decorations for your projects, full documentation for the mod is also included on the [releases](https://github.com/inkoalawetrust/Military-Vehicles-Pack/releases) section. The vehicle sprites and models are all made by me unless otherwise specified.

## Showcase videos
The below videos serve as showcases and overviews of each of the vehicles that are part of the pack.

### Army Truck: https://youtu.be/au_r7aJN9Lw

## What can they do ? (Overview)

### In general (Shared by all vehicles)
- Includes a working headlight system, where the vehicles will turn their headlights on and off dynamically if the area around them gets too dark.
- Try to keep their distance away from all enemies, instead of just blindly charging into their opponents' face like NPCs normally do.
- Eventually stop chasing their enemy if it has gone out of sight for too long. Instead of trying to chase them forever like normal NPCs.
### The Army Car

- Includes an (Optional) [Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzG4oEutPbA) [Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System) that can stun groups of most weak enemies, while the pain ray is charging up, any enemy marines near the target zone will begin running away, like they run from grenades.
- Drops down 3 marines (Except the driver.), that can then attack on behalf of the cars' side, and otherwise act like normal marines.
- Can carry different types of supplies that players on the cars' side can use, using the cars' supplies while it is moving will cause it to stop for a bit, so you don't need to chase it around to get more ammounition/health/armor.
- Includes multiple different prop versions of the car, from different versions of the car when it is destroyed, to a configurable prop of the normal, non-destroyed car.

### The Army Truck
![](https://i.imgur.com/MOu9Xatm.png)
- Has 100 more health than the Army Car, however, it's overall more fragile than the Car, and is especially more vulnerable to the "Explosion" "ExplosiveImpact" and "MarineGrenade" damage tyoes. 
- Has no weapons of its' own, not even a non-lethal one like the Army Car. However, it can deploy up to 14 marines (Or more if you want it to.). This allows it to be much more potentially dangerous than the Army Car (Or several of them.).
- Has the (Optional) ability to ram enemies, causing a ton of melee damage based on the speed at which it hits. The truck only rams enemies once it has no marines left inside. And if it hits any ally, it simply pushes them out of the way, all marines will try to run away from the truck while it's ramming.
- Includes multiple different prop versions of the truck, from different versions of the truck when it is destroyed, to a configurable prop of the normal, non-destroyed truck.
